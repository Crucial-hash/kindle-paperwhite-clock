<h1 align="center">Kindle Paperwhite Clock</h1>


- The main part of this project is the [Clock Design](/images/pixel-lockscreen-clock.png) which is inspired by Google's [Material You](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) Design. The lock screen is where this clock's design is from, being called the "double line" clock.




## Prerequisites

- Kindle Paperwhite 2 (PW2) (You may be able to use other Kindle's but the website will not be optimised).
- [Jailbroken Kindle](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=346037) with [Alpine Linux](https://github.com/thomaspreece/alpine_kindle/) installed. (This is a modified version with Midori browser instead of Chromium which works better on the PW2 but for other Kindle's it should work.).
- Always-on Computer (Server), There may be ways to work around this, but this is what I did to access the website. (Make sure to download [Python](https://www.python.org/) and download the libraries [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/), [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/), and [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) if you want to use the prayer function. You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) library to host the server.




## Instructions

- This will be brief but should somewhat guide you to replicating this on your own.


### Server

- Clone the repository and place the folder where you need it.
- Open command prompt in the folder and type this command ``` http-server -c-1 ```.
- Run the python file in the background.


### Kindle Paperwhite

- Before booting into Alpine Linux, in the search bar type âˆ¼ds, this will disable the screensaver, therefore, stopping the screen from turning off.
- This is optional but I prefer the backlight off, you can do this by placing a magnet on the back off the kindle to trick it into thinking the cover is closed.
- Boot into Alpine Linux through KUAL and open Midori.
- Use the IP address from before, you should then see the website.
- Click the fullscreen icon in the top right.
